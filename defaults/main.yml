# Restic forget policy:
# How many snapshots do we want to keep?
#
# Rules for keep_T: N
# - For last N units of time T {hour, day, week, month, year},
#   that have snapshots, keep among them only the most recent N snapshots.
# - Overlapping "keep_" filters have a safe "OR" effect: a snapshot just needs
#   one matching filter to be kept.
#
# Implications
# - 1st latest, 1st daily and 1st weekly are always the same snapshot.
# - if backups are only done weekly, then keep_{weekly, daily, hourly, last}
#   are redundant, as only units of time (like hours) that have a snapshot are
#   taken into account, even if they are from different greater units (days, weeks).
# - when combining non divisor/multiple units (like weeks and months) the
#   total amount of kept snapshots may fluctuate.
#
# Note:
# - setting one keep filter variable to 0 has a safe ignore effect
# - official docs: https://restic.readthedocs.io/en/stable/060_forget.html#removing-snapshots-according-to-a-policy
#
# Total kept snapshots:
# with last=4, daily=3, weekly=4 and daily automatic backups:
# - `last` only takes effect if more than one snapshot is taken in a day, that is, manualy.
# - `daily` will keep 3 daily snapshots
# - `weekly` will keep 3 extra snapshots, last Sundays.
